# Sales Data Analysis – Financial Reporting 

## Overview
This project is a **Power BI financial reporting dashboard** built on an Australian sales dataset.  
The dashboard focuses on **reporting and analyzing sales revenue, profit, margins, growth, and revenue distribution** across time, geography, customers, and sales channels.

The purpose of the dashboard is to support **standard financial reporting and performance analysis**, rather than forecasting or financial health scoring.


## Sales & Revenue Reporting
The dashboard reports **total sales revenue and profit** for selected time periods, with supporting metrics such as **margin contribution** and **year-over-year (YoY) growth**. These metrics allow comparison of revenue performance across different periods and provide visibility into how margins contribute to total revenue.


## Time-Based Analysis
Sales revenue is analyzed across **years, months, and quarters** to track historical performance and identify changes over time.  
The dashboard enables:
- Year-over-year revenue comparisons  
- Identification of highest- and lowest-performing months and quarters  
- Measurement of revenue increases or decreases between consecutive periods  


## Geographic Revenue Analysis (Australia)
Revenue is broken down by **territory and city within Australia**, highlighting:
- Top and bottom revenue-generating territories  
- Top and bottom revenue-generating cities  

This analysis supports regional performance comparison and identification of geographic concentration in sales revenue.


## Customer & Channel Reporting
Customer-level reporting identifies the **top customers by total revenue**, supporting visibility into key revenue contributors.

Revenue is also segmented by **sales channel** (Wholesale, Distributor, Export), allowing comparison of channel contribution to overall sales revenue.


## Interactivity
The dashboard includes interactive filters, particularly **date slicers**, enabling users to dynamically adjust the reporting period and analyze how revenue and profit metrics change over time.
